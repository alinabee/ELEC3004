# ELEC3004 Instructional Material
Instructional Code for the University of Queensland's course entitled Signals and Systems

## Getting Started
You will need Python installed on your system and for the notebooks you will need Jupyter notebooks installed.

The easiest way to do this on Windows is to install the [WinPython distribution](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/). 
This has Jupyter notebooks and most scientific packages pre-installed along with a working Python interpreter.
Launch Jupyter using the shortcut in the WinPython install directory.

On Linux, simply install the packages via your favourite package manaer.
