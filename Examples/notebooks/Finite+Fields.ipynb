    "In this notebook, we show how a system can represent an infinite mathematical system with only a finite number of values. The finite field is the basis of the discrete Fourier transform, also known as the finite Fourier transform, the original name given to it by Cooley and Tukey, though it was known to Gauss. Here, a field is a mathematical system that is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division."

If we use the remainders $r$ to the nearest multiple of $p$ or $\\pmod p$, we create a set of residue classes (which act like pigeon holes where we put the remainders in) which are finite in number, namely $0\\leq r < p$. This is written as the equation $n\\equiv r \\pmod p$."

Then the operation of division by $a$ can be replaced with a multiplication with its multiplicative inverse $a^{-1}$. To do this, we can precompute these inverses (since the classes as finite and known) using the extended Euclidean algorithm."
